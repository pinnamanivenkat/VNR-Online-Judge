<p style="margin-left: 0px;">Coco Jr. is the mayor of the Chocolate land. The whole chocolate land map is divided into n*m grid, where each cell is called as sectors. A sector can contain cultivable lands as well as roads seperating them. Coco wants to store the map in the form of matrix for which he hired Pods(Machine Learning Engineer) to develop a Spacial Recognition algorithm. Pods did a wonderful job in creating the matrix, But is not able to write an algorithm to read the matrix and perform computations on it. She is seeking your help to do that.</p><p style="margin-left: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(74, 74, 74);">Your task is to write a program, which could find out the combined area of cultivable lands from possible sectors, which are not seperated by roads, as well as number of such combined sectors possible.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p style="margin-left: 0px;">Constraints:</p><ul><li>1&lt;=n,m&lt;=50</li><li>0&lt;=s[i][j]&lt;=1000000&nbsp;</li></ul><hr><p style="margin-left: 0px;">Input:</p><ul><li>First line of input contains the two integers n,m denoting dimensions of created matrix.</li><li>Followed by n lines, each line containing m spaced integers s[i][j] denoting the area of cultivable land present in a sector (i,j). 0 denotes the road between sectors</li></ul><hr><p style="margin-left: 0px;">Output:</p><ul><li>First line of output should contain the number of combined sectors.</li><li>Second line of output should contain the area of combined sectors in ascending order.</li></ul><hr><p style="margin-left: 0px;">Example:</p><p style="margin-left: 0px;">Input:</p><p style="margin-left: 0px;">3 3</p><p style="margin-left: 0px;">4 0 6</p><p style="margin-left: 0px;">7 0 8</p><p style="margin-left: 0px;">8 0 5</p><p style="margin-left: 0px;">Output:</p><p style="margin-left: 0px;">2</p><p style="margin-left: 0px;">19 19</p><hr><p style="margin-left: 0px;">Explanation:</p><p style="margin-left: 0px;">sectors 4,7,8 make one combined area =&gt; 4+7+8 = 19</p><p style="margin-left: 0px;">sectors 6,8,5 make another combined area =&gt; 6+8+5 = 19</p>
